# cci_data_bridge_inputs

This repository contains the input files for the CCI Metadata Bridge which describe the relationship between different versions of Essential Climate Variable (ECV) datasets in the CCI Open Data Portal and other external services e.g. Copernicus Climate Change Service.

This project is in a beta phase and currently only contains preliminary data for a subset of ECV's.
